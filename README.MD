# Learning Effective STL
* container:
	*  assocContainer	
		* map &mulitmap
		* set & mulitset
	
	* sequence
		* vector
		* string
		* deque
		* list

* iterator
	* advance & distance (cast const_iterator to iterator )
	* istreambuf_iterator: read all chars  included white space \n and so on
	
* algorithm
    *  transform
    *  a lot of sorting methods
    *  erase-remove
    *  be careful removePtr
